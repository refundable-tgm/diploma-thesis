@techreport{Nurseitov,
abstract = {This paper compares two data interchange formats currently used by industry applications; XML and JSON. The choice of an adequate data interchange format can have significant consequences on data transmission rates and performance. We describe the language specifications and their respective setting of use. A case study is then conducted to compare the resource utilization and the relative performance of applications that use the interchange formats. We find that JSON is significantly faster than XML and we further record other resource-related metrics in our results.},
